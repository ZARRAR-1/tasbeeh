# tasbeeh

A new Tasbeeh project on Flutter .

This project is a starting point for a Tasbeeh (Rosary) Application, started up as a class assignment for the course of "Software For Mobile Devices", made by team: SNOWLEOPARDS (k191095 Ma'arij Abdul Qadir, k191069 Syed Abeer Hussain and k191056 Anish Rajput).

This application holds the current value of the counter even when the application is re-launched. This persistence is achieved by storing Key-value data on disk/device using shared_preferences plugin available at pub.dev (https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences).
